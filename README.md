# Nesbitt.io

Personal blog built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

I write about package management, software supply chain security, and open source infrastructure. I'm building [Ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms), a collection of open datasets and tools for understanding and improving critical open source infrastructure.
