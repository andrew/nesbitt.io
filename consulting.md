I've spent over fifteen years building infrastructure that maps, monitors, and makes sense of the software supply chain. [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io), [Ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms), [git-pkgs](https://github.com/andrew/git-pkgs), the [Manifest podcast](https://manifest.fm), the [Package Management devroom at FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/package-management/)—all of it comes from the same obsession: understanding how software gets assembled from other people's software.

I've written integrations for dozens of package managers, tracked billions of dependency relationships, and watched the same design mistakes repeat across ecosystems for a decade. That pattern recognition is what I bring to consulting engagements.

## What I can help with

**Package manager design & architecture.** If you're building a package manager, registry, or dependency resolver—or trying to fix one—I can help you avoid the mistakes that RubyGems, npm, and PyPI learned the hard way. Namespace design, version constraint semantics, lockfile formats, registry APIs, lifecycle hooks, trust models.

**Software supply chain security.** Dependency confusion, typosquatting, maintainer succession, trusted publishing, SBOM generation and enrichment, vulnerability scanning strategy. I've catalogued the attacks and the defenses across every major ecosystem.

**Package management governance.** Registries aren't just technical systems—they make political choices about naming, ownership, deletion, and dispute resolution. I can advise on governance models, policy design, and the tradeoffs between open publishing and gated review. I co-organise the [Package Management devroom at FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/package-management/), contribute to the [OpenSSF Securing Software Repos working group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos), and have studied how dozens of ecosystems handle namespace policy, package removal, maintainer succession, and trust delegation. Whether you're a registry operator designing policies, a foundation setting ecosystem standards, or a company navigating the governance landscape of your dependencies, I can help.

**Open source ecosystem intelligence.** Ecosyste.ms tracks 13+ million packages across 50+ registries, 290 million repositories, and 24 billion dependency edges. I can help you understand your dependency landscape, identify critical infrastructure in your supply chain, or build tooling on top of this data.

**Dependency management strategy.** Audit your dependency practices, evaluate package manager choices, design internal registry architecture, or build a supply chain security programme from scratch.

**Open source software development.** I've been [building and maintaining](https://github.com/andrew) open source for over fifteen years. I created [octobox](https://octobox.io), [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass), [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com), and [Split](https://github.com/splitrb/split), and contributed to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). I can help with open source strategy—launching projects, building contributor communities, managing releases, handling the maintainer burnout problem, and making sustainability decisions before they become urgent. If you're a company open-sourcing a project or trying to build a healthy ecosystem around one, I've seen what works and what doesn't.

**Research & analysis.** Guest lectures, technical reports, ecosystem comparisons, landscape surveys. I've presented at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org), [NYU Secure Systems Lab](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/), the [Software Mentions in OpenAlex workshop](https://nesbitt.io/posts/), and contributed to work with [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/), and [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/).

## How it works

Typically an initial call to understand what you're dealing with, then either a short engagement (a few days of focused work) or ongoing advisory. I'm flexible on structure.

I'm based in the UK and work remotely. I've worked with companies large and small, startups, foundations, and academic research groups.
