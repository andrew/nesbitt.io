I've written integrations for dozens of package managers, tracked billions of dependency relationships, and watched the same design mistakes repeat across ecosystems for a decade. That pattern recognition is what I bring to consulting engagements. I help you avoid the mistakes that cost other registries years of technical debt.

**Available for consulting on package management, software supply chain security, and open source infrastructure.** Email [andrew@nesbitt.io](mailto:andrew@nesbitt.io) or find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@andrewnez).

Over fifteen years I've built [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io), [Ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms), [git-pkgs](https://github.com/andrew/git-pkgs), the [Manifest podcast](https://manifest.fm), co-organised the [Package Management devroom at FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/package-management/), and contributed to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). All from the same obsession: understanding how software gets assembled from other people's software.

## What I can help with

**Package manager design & architecture.** If you're building a package manager, registry, or dependency resolver, or trying to fix one, I can help you avoid the mistakes that RubyGems, npm, and PyPI learned the hard way. I've documented the design patterns, tradeoffs, and failure modes across dozens of ecosystems in my [cross-ecosystem package manager documentation](/package-managers/). Namespace design, version constraint semantics, lockfile formats, registry APIs, lifecycle hooks, trust models.

**Software supply chain security.** I've found and catalogued dependency confusion attacks, typosquatting campaigns, [slopsquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopsquatting) (a term I popularized), malicious maintainer takeovers, and protestware incidents across every major ecosystem. Trusted publishing, SBOM generation and enrichment, vulnerability scanning strategy. I know what actually works and what's security theatre.

**Package management governance.** Registries aren't just technical systems. They make political choices about naming, ownership, deletion, and dispute resolution. I contribute to [Alpha-Omega](https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/), [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/), [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), and [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) working groups. Whether you're a registry operator designing policies, a foundation setting ecosystem standards, or a company navigating the governance landscape of your dependencies, I can help.

**Open source ecosystem intelligence.** Ecosyste.ms tracks 13+ million packages across 50+ registries, 290 million repositories, and 24 billion dependencies, the largest public dependency graph available. I can help you understand your dependency landscape, identify critical infrastructure in your supply chain, or build tooling on top of this data.

**Internal dependency strategy.** For enterprise teams: audit your dependency practices, evaluate package manager choices, design internal registry architecture, set procurement policies, or build a supply chain security programme from scratch.

**Open source strategy.** I've [built and maintained](https://github.com/andrew) open source for over fifteen years: [octobox](https://octobox.io), [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass), [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com), [Split](https://github.com/splitrb/split), and contributions to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). I've designed web applications that scale to millions of users. If you're launching projects, building contributor communities, or making sustainability decisions, I've seen what works and what doesn't.

**Research & analysis.** Guest lectures, technical reports, ecosystem comparisons, landscape surveys. I've presented at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) and [NYU Secure Systems Lab](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/), spoken at the [Software Mentions in OpenAlex workshop](https://nesbitt.io/posts/), and contributed to research with [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/), and [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/).

## How it works

Typically an initial call to understand what you're dealing with, then either a short engagement (a few days of focused work) or ongoing advisory. I'm flexible on structure.

I'm based in the UK and work remotely. I've worked at [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com). Past clients include package registry operators, open source foundations (CHAOSS, OpenSSF), enterprise platform teams, and academic research groups (NYU, Software Heritage).
